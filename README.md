Each of these implementations have different outcomes toward the pacman. 


** Usage **
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the program through terminal 
```
cd repo
run the command from the commands.txt
```
There are list of commands given in the above commands.txt and each of these command is related to the behavior of the pacman, searching algorithm used, maps of the pacman, etc.
